# Hypermedia Analysis

## Goal
This project tries to establish a baseline concerning [HATEOAS](http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow) [deployment](http://www.infoq.com/articles/mark-baker-hypermedia) on the Web, that is, collecting a statistically relevant sample of representations offered by so called RESTful APIs and determine to what degree they 'contain hypermedia'.

## Method
We will do this in two phases:

* First, we will use the [Programmable Web API](http://api.programmableweb.com/) to determine target APIs and retrieve representative samples of representations from those APIs in an automated fashion.
* Second, we will, manually, evaluate the repository of API representations and determine how to measure the 'degree of hypermedia' used.
